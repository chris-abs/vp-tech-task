# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Project running

- To get the project started locally we need a .env file with the following variable
  VITE_API_KEY=yj2bV48J40KsBpIMLvrZZ1j1KwxN4u3A83H8IBvI

Since this is a publically available API, env variables aren't necessarily needed (+ adding it here makes it completely pointless), but can never be too careful with API keys and it would never normally be stored in plain text in a typical repo's readme.

- npm install

- npm run dev
